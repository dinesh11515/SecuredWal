# SecuredWal

SecuredWal , leveraging Fantom, Web3Auth and Polybase, offers an added layer of security and control by requiring multiple signatures for transaction authorization. This unique combination allows users to create MultiSig wallets using their Google accounts with web3 wallets like MetaMask, resulting in heightened security and increased control compared to traditional single-signature wallets.
